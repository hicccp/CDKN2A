HNSCC CDKN2A Expression Study README
Overview
This repository hosts data tables for a study on the prognostic significance of CDKN2A gene expression in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC), analyzed through pathomics.

Dataset
The repository includes two CSV files:

HNSC_OS_CDKN2A.csv: Contains patient outcomes and CDKN2A expression levels.
HNSC_CDKN2A_Pathomics_features.csv: Extracted pathomics features for each case.
Requirements
Basic data processing tools that support CSV files are needed for analysis (e.g., Excel, R, Python with pandas).

Usage
Data can be utilized for replicating study results or further analysis. Instructions for basic operations:

Review HNSC_OS_CDKN2A.csv for survival outcomes correlated with CDKN2A expression.
Analyze HNSC_CDKN2A_Pathomics_features.csv for pathomics features relevant to CDKN2A expression.
